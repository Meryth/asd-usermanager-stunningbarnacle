## Description
This project is a simple Usermanager System in which the user is able to create an User to login to the system and was built with Java Spring, using a simple h2-database.

## Installation & Start
Clone the project and open it on IntelliJ. `Clean` and `Install` with Maven. Afterwards, navigate to `UsermanagerApplication` and run the main function inside of it. Wait until the server started, before opening a webbrowser of your choice and enter `localhost:8080` in the search bar. 

## Usage
It is a simple CRUD Web Application. You can create a new user and login with the created user. Once logged in, you can change your password or delete your account.

## Issues

#### Database:
It might be that the `h2-database` does not get automatically created. In this case, you need to manually create a file called `stunningbarnacleDB.mv.db`.
